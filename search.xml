<li><p><strong>Volume:</strong> It’s the dimension of big data related to its size and<br>its exponential growth.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Variety:</strong> refers to the ever-increasing different forms that data can come in such as text, images, voice, and geospatial data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Velocity:</strong> refers to the increasing speed at which big data is created and the increasing speed at which the data needs to be stored and analyzed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch Processing （Slow）:</strong> Collect Data, Clean Data, Feed-In Chunks, Wait, Act. </li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Processing ( Fast):</strong> Instantly Capture Streaming Data, Feed real-time to machines, Process Real-Time, Act.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Veracity:</strong> refers to the quality of big data. It sometimes gets referred to as validity or volatility referring to the lifetime of the data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Valence (connectedness):</strong> The more connected data is, the higher it’s valences</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Value:</strong> The ultimate goal of big data is to get value out to the data.</p>

Defining the Questions - Building a big data strategy:"></a><strong>2. Defining the Questions - Building a big data strategy:</strong></h5><p>As a summary, when building a big data strategy,it is important to </p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate big data analytics with business objectives</li>
<li>Communicate goals and provide organizational buy-in (Commitment, Sponsorship, Communication) for analytics projects</li>
<li>Build teams with diverse talents, and establish a teamwork mindset.</li>
<li>Remove barriers to data access and integration</li>
<li>Finally, these activities need to be iterated to respond to new business goals and technological advances</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Five P’s of Data Science</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/fivep.png" alt="Hadoop Ecosystem"></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose refers to the challenge or set of challenges defined by your big data strategy. The purpose can be related to a scientific analysis with a hypothesis or a business metric that needs to be analyzed based often on Big Data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People:</strong> The data scientists are often seen as people who possess skills on a variety of topics including science or business domain knowledge; analysis using statistics, machine learning and mathematical knowledge; data management, programming, and computing. In practice, this is generally a group of researchers comprised of people with complementary skills.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Process:</strong> The process of data science includes techniques for statistics, machine learning, programming, computing, and data management. A process is conceptual in the beginning and defines the course set of steps and how everyone can contribute to it. Note that similar reusable processes can apply to many applications with different purposes when employed within different workflows. Data science workflows combine such steps in executable graphs. We believe that process-oriented thinking is a transformative way of conducting data science to connect people and techniques to applications. Execution of such a data science process requires access to many datasets, Big and small, bringing new opportunities and challenges to Data Science. There are many Data Science steps or tasks, such as Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Processing/Analysis, Result Visualization, resulting in a Data Science Workflow. Data Science Processes may need user interaction and other manual operations, or be fully automated. Challenges for the data science process include 1) how to easily integrate all needed tasks to build such a process; 2) how to find the best computing resources and efficiently schedule process executions to the resources based on process definition, parameter settings, and user preferences.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Based on the needs of an application-driven purpose and the amount of data and computing required to perform this application, different computing and data platforms can be used as a part of the data science process. This scalability should be made part of any data science solution architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Programmability:</strong> Capturing a scalable data science process requires aid from programming languages, e.g., R, and patterns, e.g., MapReduce. Tools that provide access to such programming techniques are key to making the data science process programmable on a variety of platforms.</p>

The Process of Data Analysis - Five steps activities of the data science process:"></a><strong>3. The Process of Data Analysis - Five steps activities of the data science process:</strong></h5><ol>
<li><p><strong>Acquire:</strong> includes anything that makes us retrieve data including; finding, accessing, acquiring, and moving data. It includes identification of and authenticated access to all related data. And transportation of data from sources to distributed files systems</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explorer:</strong> The first step in data preparation involves looking at the data to understand its nature, what it means, its quality, and format.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-processing of data:</strong> Pre-processing includes cleaning data, sub-setting or filtering data, creating data, which programs can read and understand, such as modeling raw data into a more defined data model,or packaging it using a specific data format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Analyze:</strong> Select the analytical technique, build models.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Report:</strong> Communicating results includes evaluation of analytical results. Presenting them in a visual way, creating reports that include an assessment of results with respect to success criteria.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Act:</strong> Reporting insights from analysis and determining actions from insights based on the purpose.</p>
</li>

Basic Scalable Concepts - Scalable Computing over the Internet:"></a><strong>1. Basic Scalable Concepts - Scalable Computing over the Internet:</strong></h5><ul>
<li><strong>Parallel computer:</strong>  a parallel computer is a very large number of single computing nodes with specialized capabilities connected to other networks.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity cluster:</strong> affordable parallel computers with an average number of computing nodes.They are not as powerful as traditional parallel computers and are often built out of less specialized nodes. These types of systems have a higher potential for partial failures. It is this type of distributed computing that pushed for a change towards cost-effective reliable and Fault-tolerant systems for management and analysis of big data</li>

<h5 id="3-Getting-Started-With-Hadoop"><a href="#3-Getting-Started-With-Hadoop" class="headerlink" title="3. Getting Started With Hadoop"></a><strong>3. Getting Started With Hadoop</strong></h5><p><img src="/images/eco.png" alt="Hadoop Ecosystem"></p>
<p><strong>HDFS:</strong> The Hadoop Distributed File System, a storage system for big data.It serves as the foundation for most tools in the <strong>Hadoop ecosystem</strong>.</p>
<p>It provides two capabilities that are essential for managing big data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability to large data sets. </li>
<li>Reliability to cope with hardware failures. By default, HDFS maintains three copies of every block</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two key components of HDFS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>NameNode for Metadata:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One namenode per cluster</li>
<li>Coordinator of HDFS cluster</li>
<li>Records the name, location in the directory hierarchy and other metadata</li>
<li>Decides which data nodes to store the contents of the file and remembers this mapping</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DataNode for block storage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Datanode</strong> Runs on each node on the cluster and is responsible for storing the file blocks</li>
<li>listens to commands from the name node for block creation, deletion, and replication. </li>
<li>Replication provides two key capabilities: <ul>
<li>Fault tolerance,  Data locality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>YARN: The Resource Manager for Hadoop</strong><br>YARN interacts with applications and schedules resources for their use.</p>
<p><strong>Essential Gear in YARN engine:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource manager:</strong> controls all the resources, and decides who gets what</li>
<li><strong>Application Manager:</strong> It negotiates resource from the Resource Manager and it talks to Node Manager to get its tasks completed</li>
<li><strong>Node Manager:</strong> operates at the machine level and is in charge of a single machine</li>
<li><strong>Container (Machine):</strong> abstract Notions that signifies a resource that is a collection of CPU memory disk network and other resources within the Compute node</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mapreduce:</strong> 　　</p>
<p>　　It is a big data programming model that supports all<br>the requirements of big data modeling we mentioned. It can model processing large data, split complications into different parallel tasks and make efficient use of large commodity clusters and distributed file systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Map: Applys operation to all elements and generates key-values pairs.</li>
<li>Reduce: Summarize operation on elements and construct one output file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MapReduce is bad for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frequently changing data (slow)</li>
<li>Dependent tasks</li>
<li>Interactive analysis</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to reconsider Hadoop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Key feature that makes problem Hadoop friendly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Future anticipated data growth</li>
<li>Long term availability of data</li>
<li>Many platforms over single datastore</li>
<li>High Volume, High variety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be careful when:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small dataset</li>
<li>Task Level Parallelism ( Furuethrer analysis for which tool to use in Hadoop ecosystem)</li>
<li>Advanced algorithms (Not all algorithms are scalable in Hadoop, or reducible to one of the programming models supported by YARN</li>
<li>Random Data Access ( you may have to read an entire file just to pick one data entry)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Cloud Computing( On-demand computing: it enables us to compute any time any anywhere)</strong></h5><p><strong>Service Model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>IaaS:</strong> infrastructure as a service, can be defined as a bare minimum rental service. This is like renting a truck from a company that you can assume has hardware and you do the packing of your furniture, and drive to your new house.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>PaaS:</strong> platform as a service,<br>is the model where a user is provided with an entire computing platform.<br>This could include the operating system and programming languages that you need</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>SaaS:</strong> the software as a service model, is the model<br>in which the cloud service provider takes the responsibilities for the hardware and software environments such as the operating system and the application software</p>

Especially, when Donald Trump signed a Presidential<br>Memorandum, the United States has announced levies on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods and would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum to all the countries. However, the United States may plan to give exemption to a broad group of allies which include Canada, Mexico. Since China is also a big steel export country,apparently, this policy in some degree will possible have a big effect on Chinese steel and iron industries. We may assume this policy is aimed to against the influx cheap Chinese metal and goods, which may harm American local industry. If the exemption were successfully applied to other countries, China is going to face more severe situation under this circumstance, and the trade battle between U.S and China can possibly turn into a Trade War. This project will analyze basic American import and export of certain taxed product relates to this policy to make logic prediction of the stakes in this competition from my point of views in certain aspects.</p>

<li>Which countries that United States import and export the most?</li>
<li>Which categories that United States has the most import and export?</li>
<li>If China levy on some American export products, how this policy is going to affect the United States?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Final-Data-Visualization"><a href="#Final-Data-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="Final Data Visualization"></a>Final Data Visualization</h4><p>　R and Excel will be used for data cleaning, and Tableau will be considered as my data visualization tools. Since I am going to compare the categories and volume of import and export, bar graphs, heatmaps and pie chart are good methods to express the data. Therefore, Tableau will be my first choice to visualize my data. The data in this project is quite large and complicate, sometimes I have use R to transform my data to fit the format of Tableau. Of course, Excel will also consider as my data editing tool. Visualization types will be:<br>• Bar graph of Overall import and export value from 2000-2017<br>• Line chart of Trade deficit from 2007-2017<br>• Heatmap of Product categories that United States export and import<br>• Pie Charts of Proportion of World Soybean total production</p>
<h4 id="Data-Analysis"><a href="#Data-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Data Analysis"></a>Data Analysis</h4><h5 id="U-S-2000-2017-Overall-Import-and-Export-goods-and-service"><a href="#U-S-2000-2017-Overall-Import-and-Export-goods-and-service" class="headerlink" title="U.S 2000 - 2017 Overall Import and Export (goods and service)"></a>U.S 2000 - 2017 Overall Import and Export (goods and service)</h5><p><img src="/images/pasted-23.png" alt="upload successful"><br><img src="/images/pasted-24.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<ul>
<li>According to the bar graph of U.S overall Import and Export. From 2000 – 2017, the export and import appear rising tendency. But the trade deficit reach the highest in 2006 and reduce to 384 billions dollars then kept fluctuating around 500 billions dollars. In order to reduce the trade deficit, Trump brought up a series of trading policy on export and import.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="March-2018-The-Value-of-U-S-Export-and-Import-To-Top-15-Countries-goods-only"><a href="#March-2018-The-Value-of-U-S-Export-and-Import-To-Top-15-Countries-goods-only" class="headerlink" title="March 2018, The Value of U.S Export and Import  To Top 15 Countries.

<p><img src="/.io//images%5Cpasted-28.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<ul>
<li>By comparing two bar graphs, we can easily see that Canada, Mexico, China are top three countries in the value of American import and export. Canada is the biggest American exportation country. And China is the biggest American importation country. Since America relies on China more than China rely on America, we may logically assume once China start its retaliatory tariffs on US exports, the United State may have more loss than Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Products-that-United-States-Imports-from-China-in-2017"><a href="#Products-that-United-States-Imports-from-China-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Products that United States Imports from China in 2017"></a>Products that United States Imports from China in 2017</h5><p><img src="/images/pasted-35.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<ul>
<li>From the heatmap, we can find that the major categories that United States import are cell phones and other household goods, computer and computer accessories, telecommunication equipment and so on… These are major areas on which Donald Trump wants to apply tariffs, in order to slow down or restrict the rising trend of China taking dominant in these areas(high-tech products), and try to take America back into the leading position in these areas.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Products-that-United-States-Exports-to-China-in-2017"><a href="#Products-that-United-States-Exports-to-China-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Products that United States Exports to China in 2017"></a>Products that United States Exports to China in 2017</h5><p><img src="/images/pasted-36.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<ul>
<li>From the heatmap, we can find that the major categories that United States export to China are civilian aircraft, engines, soybeans, Passenger cars, semi-products. Those categories will be the threatens to United States and have a big chance becoming the target of China as revenge. As far as we know, Chinese government has announced that it will impose 15% tariffs on 128 American made products include fruit, nuts and wine and up to 25% on pork as initially fight back. Furthermore, Chinese government will probably keep imposing tariffs on more products made by United States depend on how the battle goes. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Threaten-Tariffs-on-Soybeans"><a href="#Threaten-Tariffs-on-Soybeans" class="headerlink" title="Threaten - Tariffs on Soybeans"></a>Threaten - Tariffs on Soybeans</h5><p><img src="/images/pasted-38.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<ul>
<li>Obviously, the United State and Brazil are two major soybeans producers as well as exporters in this world. If China imposes tariffs on soybean, which means it gives up one of the largest soybean import resource in the world, I believe that China won’t insist for a long time because there is no other supplier except U.S can provide such tremendous amount of soybeans.  </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-43.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-44.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>By comparing two graphs, it is easy to see the export pattern of two countries.  Most of soybeans in brazil were exported to China in the period from March to September. In rest of the year , China has imported soybeans from the United States, which is the reason I consider that China will keep suffering from the loss until it find a way to solve  domestic demand of soybeans. In a short period, Brazil and Argentina would be the best choice and support for China to pass through the “harsh time”. However, It is hard for China to find suppliers that can really fill China’s soybeans needs for a long term. The structure of global supply chain is not that easy to change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Moreover, We may consider another situation: Is it possible for Brazil to provide enough soybean to fulfill the demand of China? The answer is No. Maybe there are several ways that can mitigate the reliance on American soybeans such as importing more soybeans from Brazil and Argentina; however, there is no way that China can stay away from the loss. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Threaten-Tariffs-on-Pork-and-Meat-Products"><a href="#Threaten-Tariffs-on-Pork-and-Meat-Products" class="headerlink" title="Threaten - Tariffs on Pork and Meat Products"></a>Threaten - Tariffs on Pork and Meat Products</h5><p><img src="/images/pasted-41.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<ul>
<li>Broiler and pork are the main meat export product of United States, which take up42.5% and  32.35% of total meat exportation respectively. If China wants to increase the tax on meat product, the United State would have big effect on domestic farmers only if China is the big pork and broiler importer of the United States.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Future-Work"><a href="#Future-Work" class="headerlink" title="Future Work"></a>Future Work</h4><ul>
<li><p>The effect of Tariffs between two large countries has always been a complicate issue. The change of tariffs in a large will not only affect domestic supply and demand or domestic price, but also will have big global effect. Taking a simple example in this case, the policy that China imposes tariffs on soybeans will definitely benefit to Brazil, Argentina and all other countries who have ability to provide soybeans. </p>
</li>
<li><p>This project can expend to many areas. Base on the information I concluded, we just need to gather a little bit more of data on globe soybean price to calculate the effect of tariffs on the volume change of Import and export as result. </p>
</li>
<li><p>We can furthermore investigate whether the tariffs on Auto has really harmed the interest of those Giant Auto companies. Because Tariffs is such a complicate topic, we can apply many economic concepts and do the research</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Conclusion-and-Prediction"><a href="#Conclusion-and-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion and Prediction"></a>Conclusion and Prediction</h4><p>　All the activities between China and the United State are just the “normal”friction in the international trade. I don’t believe that the tension and friction between　these two superpower countries so far will escalate into the real Trade War. And I don’t think they will even allow this happen. We know China and America play vital roles in the global economy, the chain reaction of trade war in global and national economy is going to be destructive; therefore, there is no way for both China and the United State to be involve in a long-term trade battle. China won’t, neither Donald Trump. Overall, people are responsible for countries’ international trade policies. Even though statistics says the effect of certain policy is minor, the loss is on people and people who has business involved. It is simple logic for everyone to understand that collaboration between two countries can lead to win-win situation. Negotiation is<br>the best way to reduce the friction and solve problems, which is what China and America are doing right now. If two countries reach a common agreement, the trade battle will eventually end.</p>

<p>To evaluate the quality of data, we can follow the Six Standard Data Quality Dimension: </p>
<a id="more"></a>

<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: The degree to which the data correctly describe the ‘real-world’ objects. <strong>Example:</strong> <em>if a man is 30 years old, but the data is 35 years old.</em></li>
<li><strong>Completeness</strong>: Whether the data fulfill the expectation of business comprehensiveness; in other words, whether you can extract the information you want from the data.</li>
<li><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: Make sure there is no duplicate record in the dataset. <strong>Example</strong>: <em>There are 300 students in total, but there are 350 records</em></li>
<li><strong>Timeliness</strong>：Make sure that the data is recorded at the time when it occurred. No delay.</li>
<li><strong>Validity</strong>：Data are valid if it conforms to the syntax (format, type, range) of its definition.**</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>：The data should be the same as input in other columns.<strong>Example</strong>: <em>If a student name:’Peter Pan’ is in the class name-list, then ‘Peter Pan’in the school name-list should be the same as class name-list.</em> </li>

    <title>Web-Mining Full Project Report</title>
    <url>/2020/06/26/web-Mining-Full-Project-Report/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>In retrospect my first NLP project,it was a really great learning experience that got me through the process of nature language processing, and piqued my interest to the Data Science.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>　In the past one year, PUBG became one of the most popular games in the word and at the same time it also received thousands of negative comments and thus I planned to start a project to help those developers and operators extract valuable information from those critics. The purpose of my project is to get suggestions from those critics, and then I plan to assign labels for players manually to classify those clear-minded supporters and critics and then train some classification models to discover more critics with firm stand.Finally, I will propose some future improvements for this project which I could have done better and also as reference for my next project.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h3 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h3><p>　PUBG, one of the most popular shooting games on steam, was published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. This game was released officially in September 2018. The game is one of the best-selling of all time, with over fifty million sold across all platforms by June 2018. In addition, the Windows version holds a peak concurrent player count of over three million on Steam, which is an all-time high on the platform. PUBG received thousands of reviews from players, who found that there are still many bugs and problems existed in the game.Thus, I decide to research on discovering useful information from those reviews.</p>
<h3 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h3><p>　In this project, I am trying to detect some useful information from the reviews and have a deep understanding of the game by analysis crawled from the Steam reviews community. After this project, I hope my analysis will help game developers identify the problems that most players concerned about.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Preparation"><a href="#Data-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Data Preparation"></a>Data Preparation</h3><p>　In this project, the data source comes from Steam.I use <strong>Selenium</strong> to scrape some reviews page.I use CSS selectors to get all the attributes including user comment date, user reviews, whether users recommend or not, how many hours spent on the game, and how many games users hold in the account.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Description"><a href="#Data-Description" class="headerlink" title="Data Description"></a>Data Description</h3><p>　The data size is 2070. The data contains three independent variables including spent hours, hold products and user reviews, and one dependent variable which is “recommended or not”. Spent hours refers to how many hours that players have spent on the game. Hold products refers to how many games user hold in their accounts. User reviews refer to what players comment on the website. Recommend or not refers to whether the player recommends this game or not. The sample data presented below:<br><img src="/images/pasted-1.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<p>　On the platform, each user can easily write down their feedbacks toward the game and they will assign a label of whether they want to recommend or not-recommend this game to other players. Steam will also list the information of users such as hours of playing, the Steam products in the user’s account, and other players’ attitudes toward this comment. This review system will give the game companies or developers an overall insight into how this running on this platform by collecting all the data from users’ reviews. The user interface shows below:<br> <img src="/images/pasted-2.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<h3 id="Data-cleaning"><a href="#Data-cleaning" class="headerlink" title="Data cleaning"></a>Data cleaning</h3><p>　The data contains some symbols and stop words which cause problems for me to find meaningful information from the user reviews and thus I remove these noise and transfer all characters into lower cases and split the reviews into words.</p>
<h3 id="Exploratory-Data-Analysis"><a href="#Exploratory-Data-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Exploratory Data Analysis"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3><p>　Next, I did some simple exploratory data analysis to find the correlation among these variables. Firstly, I made a bar chart to present the relation between spent hours  and recommendations<br> <img src="/images/pasted-3.png" alt="upload successful"><br>As the bar chart presents above, I find that the people who have spent more than 1900 hours on PUBG tend to recommend this game. In other words, this game is very popular with old players, and thus the reviews made by this part of players are more meaningful for the operator.<br>And then, I made a scatter plot to explore the relation between spent hours and hold products.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-6.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<h3 id="Modeling"><a href="#Modeling" class="headerlink" title="Modeling"></a>Modeling</h3><p>　In this part, I use both supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms to make models.</p>
<h4 id="Unsupervised-learning"><a href="#Unsupervised-learning" class="headerlink" title="Unsupervised learning"></a>Unsupervised learning</h4><h5 id="VADER"><a href="#VADER" class="headerlink" title="VADER"></a>VADER</h5><p>　<strong>VADER</strong> analyzes a piece of text to see if any of the words in the text is present in the lexicon. Sentiment metrics are derived from the ratings of such words positive, neutral, and negative, represent the proportion of the text that falls into those categories.The final metric, the compound score, is the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been standardized to range between -1 and 1 based on some heuristics.In my project, I want to see users’ sentiment for each of the reviews by applying VADER analysis, and group those negative sentiment reviews for company inspect.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-7.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<p>　From the result shown above, reviews have been classified into three categories: positive sentiment, neutral sentiment, and negative sentiment.In positive sentiment,77.45% of reviews have been correctly　classified;In neutral sentiment,75.33 are recommended reviews and 24.66% are not recommended reviews; In negative sentiment, 26.38% negative reviews　have been correctly classified.I visualize the model result.The model has bad performance on negative sentiment. And then I try to find the reasons.After I dig into the reviews, I find out the reviews sometimes full of sarcasm, the computer is not capable of recognizing the emotion behind the sentences. For example: “This game used to be good, but now it is just game for cheaters.” Then I got a conclusion that the labels in the review system didn’t truly reflect the attitudes of players and the game developer can also possibly mislead by the data of labels.</p>
<h5 id="LDA"><a href="#LDA" class="headerlink" title="LDA"></a>LDA</h5><p>　Due to the massive information of reviews, it’s difficult for operators to analyze the reviews one by one. So, I use LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) to generate topics for the document. This model reduces the dimensionalities of words and thus it worked more efficiently compared with bag-of-words model and got rid of overfitting. I visualized three top topics as below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-9.png" alt="upload successful"><br>　Through these pictures, I found more negative words than positive words. These words state that the server of the game is bad and mountains of cheaters in this game and this game didn’t make any improvement over time. This result may confuse us why there are more negative words about this game, and in the EDA stage I found more people recommended this game.In the VADER model, I have found that 75.33% of people who have neutral attitudes have been classified as supporters. And by reading some comments, I found that these people’s comments contain a lot of negative words and that’s the reason why I found so many negative words here. Through the LDA and VADER model, I got a conclusion that I cannot simply classify people by their comments’ labels, and thus, I planned to select those clear-minded comments to train the classification model to find more players with a firm stand.</p>
<h4 id="Supervised-learning"><a href="#Supervised-learning" class="headerlink" title="Supervised learning"></a>Supervised learning</h4><p>　The classification models are applied to detect positive and negative users. Since there are a great many reviews are not labeled in other sources. It is necessary to classify a large number of reviews and get directions for later improvement, especially from the negative sentiments.</p>
<h5 id="Multinomial-Naive-Bayes"><a href="#Multinomial-Naive-Bayes" class="headerlink" title="Multinomial Naïve Bayes"></a>Multinomial Naïve Bayes</h5><p>　<strong>Multinomial Naïve Bayes</strong> is suitable for classification with word counts for text classification, such as TF-IDF weight.<br>As the result shows above, this model has a good performance. The precision rate is 0.84 and the recall rate is 0.82.<br><img src="/images/pasted-11.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<h5 id="Support-Vector-Classification"><a href="#Support-Vector-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Support Vector Classification"></a>Support Vector Classification</h5><p>　<strong>Support vector machine</strong> constructs a hyper-plane or set of hyper-planes in a high or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification. As the pictures are shown above, a good separation is achieved by the hyper-plane that has the largest distance to the nearest training data points of any class. It has 0.85 of precision rate and 0.83 of recall rate.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-12.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<h5 id="Logistic-Regression"><a href="#Logistic-Regression" class="headerlink" title="Logistic Regression"></a><strong>Logistic Regression</strong></h5><p>　<strong>Logistic Regression</strong> model the probabilities of a recommendation as a linear function of documents term matrix and classify reviews into two categories based on TF-IDF weights of bag-of-words.<br>As the pictures are shown above, it has 84% precision rate and 80% recall rate. In summary, MNB, SVM, and Logistic Regression have good performance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-13.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<h5 id="CNN"><a href="#CNN" class="headerlink" title="CNN"></a><strong>CNN</strong></h5><p>　<strong>CNN</strong> model is introduced since it has advantages in imbalanced data classification. The doc2vec and word2vec are used to train a large number of unlabeled reviews to generate a fixed weights word matrix to map the word in the embedding phase. The doc2vec is different in predicting the word by concatenating the paragraph vector D (shared within the paragraph). The words vector trained by Doc2Vec has a better performance when checking the similarities of the words.<br>The figure describes the top 5 most similar word with ‘play’:</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-14.png" alt="upload successful"><br>The CNN model is using three sizes of filters (bigram, trigram, and quadrigram), each size has 64 filters in the convolutional layer.</p>
<p><img src="/.io//images%5Cpasted-15.png" alt="upload successful"><br>In summary, the CNN model that using a pre-trained matrix has a better performance as the picture shown above.</p>
<h3 id="Word-Interpretation"><a href="#Word-Interpretation" class="headerlink" title="Word Interpretation"></a>Word Interpretation</h3><p>　To get some insights from negative sentiment reviews, I use TFIDF weights and Word2Vec to dig out content from reviews.<br>As the picture shows, I picked the top ten words which have the highest frequency. Some words such as bad, time, money are keywords that might point to the potential problem.<br>Next step, I use Word2Vec to find the most similar words with these top 10 words, trying to find correlations between targeted words.<br>As a result, the problems found are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lot of game issues</li>
<li>Serious time delay for server lags</li>
<li>Devs(Developer) fix the bug</li>
<li>Vehicle issue in the game</li>
<li>Waste money</li>
<li>A lot of cheaters</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>　In unsupervised learning, I found that the label in the dataset cannot accurately describe the attitude of players, but the purpose of my project is to excavate valuable information from critics and thus it’s very important to train a model to find those critics with frim stand. And then I trained several classification models including Multinomial Naïve Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, and CNN, and found that CNN has the best performance among these models. Finally, I explain the words meaning after classification and then give the suggestion based on what I got from the result and raise the suggestion to the company. Wipe out cheaters from the game, it hugely impacts the user’s game experience. Give more support to users when they meet with game issues. Developers need to put more effort to optimize game and fix those existed bugs. Cautiously deal with the micro-transaction, make it reasonable to users.</p>
<h3 id="Future-Improvement"><a href="#Future-Improvement" class="headerlink" title="Future Improvement"></a>Future Improvement</h3><p>　There are still some improvements that I can make in the future. For example, I can try the Steam Game Platform API,and I can improve VADER by updating the word list. Since VADER is defined as Sentiment metrics techniques, I expect to improve model performance by updating the word list and re-training the model.</p>

    <title>Bitcoin Price Factor Analysis</title>
    <url>/2020/07/06/Bitcoin-Price-Factor-Analysis/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin analysis for fun.Typical time-series data analysis for reference.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>　This paper mainly discusses the factors in the market that are going to influence the Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin price formula is derived from the Barro(1979) model which also provides the concept of selecting the market factors in the formula. Since Bitcoin is not a traditional currency, it is not appropriate to use the law of supply and demand to determine its value. By adding some other market factors, the formula will become more theoretically feasible. Time-series analytic mechanism will be applied in this project</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>　The booming cryptocurrency of recent years has always caught people’s attention. Various digital coins have emerged in the market and Bitcoin has become one of the most prominent of them because of its dramatic price rising and price volatility. Yet while many people are still confused about what is the Bitcoin, where does it come from and how does it work, Bitcoin has already shaken the financial world to its core.<br>The rising of Bitcoin is quite long and winding. In late 2008, a person or group whose name Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper called Bitcoin – A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash system to explain the idea of cryptocurrency - It is a type of decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user. In 2010, the Bitcoin was first used to trade in the real world but there are still very few people know about it at that time. However, the price volatility of Bitcoin doom to make investors suffer from the big fall. Shortly after Bitcoin reached 1000 dollars in November 2013, the price rapidly dropped to around 300 dollars. Ever since then, the price has begun its long-run rising journey. The prosperous period of cryptocurrency is in 2017 when almost the entire cryptocurrency market reached its all-time high in December 2017. </p>
<p>　Since Bitcoin is not issued by a government or certain bank, the macro-economic factor such as interest rate parity is not able to affect Bitcoin price, which means some standard economic theories cannot use to explain the formula of Bitcoin. <strong>Dyhrberg, A. H. (2016)</strong>, <strong>Buchholz, (2012)</strong> address that Bitcoin has shared some similar characteristics with gold and its price can be determined by the law of supply and demand in large extent. Because Bitcoin has such high price volatility, it is not enough by just applying supply and demand formula to the Bitcoin. There must exist some other factors that determine Bitcoin’s price. <strong>Barro (1979)</strong> has illustrated the way to determine the gold standard by using the law of supply and demand. Base on the Barro’s model (1979), we can derive a new estimable model by adding another market factor such as news post number on the Journal website. We apply the time-series mechanism to analyze the daily data we have selected from January 01, 2012 to January 01, 2019 and come up with the conclusion about the factors that do have a significant impact on Bitcoin price. Our study will give other people or investors an insight into the way that how those factors affect Bitcoin price, which will give them more references and help them make decisions while they are investing Bitcoin.</p>
<h3 id="Literature-Review"><a href="#Literature-Review" class="headerlink" title="Literature Review"></a>Literature Review</h3><p>　In 1979, Barro published the outstanding paper <strong><em>Money and The Price Level Under the Gold Standard</em></strong>. The paper specifies how price level is being evaluated in commodity goods. The level of price is determinate by the analyses based on supply and demand. The outcome of these analyses will convert gold into money currency, and gold production. Though the price of gold will fluctuate, it sets a fixed price for the commodity. The fixed price is determined by the quantity of the commodity in fiat currency. In order to come up with the absolute price level, many aspects were accounted for such as its major elements. Based on the concept of this paper, we can assume the price of Bitcoin will be affected by its supply and demand. Moreover, the supply includes the total stock of Bitcoin in circulation and exchange rate of Bitcoin, and the demand includes the size of the Bitcoin economy and the velocity of Bitcoin.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multivariate Time Series Analysis</em></strong>, written by <strong>Ruey S. Tsay</strong>, summarizes the basic concepts and ideas of multivariate time series, gives econometric models and statistical models for describing the dynamic relationship between variables, discusses the discernibility problems that arise when the model is too flexible and introduces the search for hidden The method of simplifying the structure in multidimensional time series emphasizes the applicability and limitations of the multivariate time series method. It first gives some basic concepts of multivariate time series including evaluation and quantification of time and cross-section dependencies. As the data dimension increases, the difficulty of presenting multivariate data is also significantly increased. Then it introduces the vector autoregression model which is most widely used in the multi-time series analysis. Then it introduces unit root non-stationarity and cointegration. It includes the basic theory of understanding the unit root time series and some related applications.</p>
<h3 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h3><p>　As mentioned above, the concept of Bitcoin formula is based on Barro’s model. Then, the equilibrium Bitcoin price formula can be addressed as follow:<br>The supply of Bitcoin is fixed and determines the units of Bitcoin circulated in the market. Let <strong>𝐵𝑠</strong> represent the total money supply of Bitcoin, <strong>P</strong> represents Bitcoin price, and <strong>T</strong> represents the total stock of Bitcoin. We will have total money supply formula: $$𝐵^𝑠 = 𝑃𝑇$$<br>The demand of Bitcoin, <strong>𝐵𝑑</strong>, can be mainly determined by the size of Bitcoin economy, <strong>E</strong>, the days that user holding the Bitcoin, in other words, the frequency of per Bitcoin circulated in the market (days destroyed), <strong>F</strong>, and the general price level, <strong>𝑃𝑖</strong>. $$𝐵^𝑑 = \frac{𝑃𝑖𝐸}{𝐹}$$<br>　<br> The scale of the Bitcoin economy can be determined by daily trading activities. Thus, the number of Bitcoin transactions and addresses are what we use as our variables. For general price level <strong>𝑃𝑖</strong>, we apply the exchange rate between the U.S dollar and European pound as an index in the formula because our study only focuses on the U.S market. The main currency that purchases Bitcoin is U.S dollar, and if there is any appreciation or depreciation of U.S dollar against European pound; the purchasing power of U.S dollar against Bitcoin would be affected.</p>
<p>Combine the supply and demand formula we have equilibrium price formula: $$𝑃= \frac{𝑃𝑖𝐸}{𝐹𝑇}$$<br>we can rewrite the equilibrium formula as an empirical model to investigate the relationship between each variable:</p>
<p>$$𝑃_𝑡=𝛽_0+ 𝛽1𝑃𝑖_𝑡+𝛽_2𝐸_𝑡+𝛽_3𝐹_𝑡+𝛽_4𝑇_𝑡+𝜀$$<br>Bitcoin is not like any other traditional currency that controlled or issued by the government. It is not well-known to the public. The more exposure of Bitcoin, the more people will be attracted to the Bitcoin. Furthermore, if people can easily access the information they need, the search cost will be significantly reduced, which will possibly increase the investment opportunity of Bitcoin, hence increase Bitcoin price. Therefrom, we can assume the media is one of the most important factors that can influence Bitcoin price since it can easily catch people’s attention and influence people’s investment decisions. In order to make the model in line with the real world, we add one more factor that would possibly affect Bitcoin price. Here we add the Wall Street Journal’s daily news post number:<br>$$𝑃_𝑡=𝛽_0+ 𝛽1𝑃𝑖_𝑡+𝛽_2𝐸_𝑡+𝛽_3𝐹_𝑡+𝛽_4𝑇_𝑡+𝛽_5𝑁𝑒𝑤𝑠_𝑡+𝜀$$</p>
<p>　The mechanisms we use in this project are pretty straight forward. Consider the situation that variables in the formula may present the issue of endogeneity, we will use time-series analytic tools to test the properties of data step by step. Then we can figure out how those factors affect Bitcoin price by using the VAR and VEC model.</p>
<p>　In the first step, we need to do the stationary test before we do the regression, otherwise, the data will lead to spurious regression. We will use the <strong>Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)</strong> to test the stationarity of all data. After the test, we can decide whether we should differentiate our data. By observing the price of Bitcoin in the whole period, we found that there are some structural breaks, which might lead to huge forecasting errors and unreliability of the model in general. And we can use the <strong>Zivot-Andrews (ZA) test</strong> to determine the accurate position of structure break statistically.</p>
<p>　In the second step, we apply the <strong>Johansen cointegration test</strong> to determine the cointegration relationship. Cointegration test allows us to describe the stationary relationship between two or more series. For each sequence alone, it may be non-stationary. The moments of these sequences, such as mean, variance or covariance, change over time, while the linear combination of these time series may have properties that do not change with time. These linear combinations could have a stable long-term relationship.</p>
<p>　After doing the test above, we can decide whether we should use VAR or VEC model in our project.Vector autoregression is a stochastic process model used to capture the linear interdependencies among multiple time series. VAR model turns every system internal variable into a lagged variable to create the model.<br> $$\Delta{y_t} =\sum_{i=1}^{p−i}\Phi_{𝑖}𝑦_{𝑡−𝑖}+𝜀_𝑡，𝑡=1,2,…,𝑇$$</p>
<p>　In this equation, $𝑦_𝑡$ is K dimension variable, P is lagged order, T is sample size, K*K dimension matrix is a coefficient to be estimated. The goal of the cointegration test is to determine the cointegration relationship in multiple time series.</p>
<p>　Consider we have a VAR(p) model with tendency term, $$y_t=c(t)+ \sum_{i=1}^{p}\Gamma_{i}𝑦_{t−i}+ 𝜀_𝑡$$</p>
<p>$c(t)=+c_0 + c_1t$, $c_i$ is a constant term. This VAR(p) model can be rewritten as ECM as follow:<br>$$\Delta{y_t} =c(t)+c_0 + c_1t+ \Pi_{y_{t-i}}+ \sum_{i=1}^{p}\Gamma_{i}^\ast\nabla𝑦_{𝑡−𝑖}+𝜀_𝑡$$</p>
<p>Let the order of matrix $\Pi$ be m, we have two situations:</p>
<p>1) Rank($\Pi$)=0, means none cointegration vectors. In this situation, $𝑦_𝑡$ have k unit roots. It becomes a VAR($p-1$) model.<br>2) Rank($\Pi$)=𝑚&gt;0, In this situation, $𝑦_𝑡$ have m cointegration vectors and k-m unit roots. So, there are k*m non-singular matrixs 𝛼 and 𝛽,<br>$$\Pi=\alpha\beta’$$</p>
<p>Vectors 𝜔𝑡=𝛽′$𝑦_𝑡$ is a I(0) process, called cointegration sequence, and 𝛼 represents how the cointegration sequence influence $\Delta{y_t}$.<br>Putting the cointegration test and ECM together, we have a VEC model. This model can be regarded as a VAR model with cointegrated restriction.</p>
<p>$$\Delta{y_t} =\alpha\beta{y_{t-1}} + \sum_{i=1}^{p−i}\Gamma_{𝑖}\Delta{𝑦_{𝑡−𝑖}}+𝜀_𝑡，𝑡=1,2,…,𝑇$$<br>It includes the regression speed of Alpha that diverged from long term equilibrium. Beta is error correction represents the long-term relationship. The coefficients of the differential terms reflect their short-term relationship. We can delete the insignificant lagged differential term.</p>
<p> In our article, we will calculate the β𝑦𝑡−1 which is error correction term 𝑒𝑐𝑚𝑡−1 by using the Johansen cointegration test and calculate all other parameters $\Gamma_i$ by applying the VEC algorithm.<br>Finally, we analyze matrix β to know the long-run relationship between Bitcoin price and other variables and then use variance decomposition to analyze the short-run effect and the proportion of each variable in the regression.</p>
<h3 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h3><h4 id="Augmented-Dickey-Fuller-Test-for-unit-root"><a href="#Augmented-Dickey-Fuller-Test-for-unit-root" class="headerlink" title="Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test for unit root"></a>Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test for unit root</h4><p><img src="/images/pasted-50.png" alt="upload successful"><br>　According to the price chart of Bitcoin above, we can see that the price trend in one period is obviously different from the others, and we build a hypothesis that there is a structural break in this period. From the plot, we estimate the structural break begins at 2017/04/01. Then we use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test for unit root and split the data into three sections: the first section is the whole period; the second section is from 2012/01/01 to 2017/11/16; the third section is from 2017/11/16 to 2019/01/01.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-51.png" alt="upload successful"><br>　All the p-values are quite large, which means that the data is not stationary. Then we need to perform a differential treatment and then observe the stationarity of the data further.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-52.png" alt="upload successful"><br>　After the first derivative, the p-values are significant, which means the data are basically stationary so that we can conduct further study on the data.</p>
<h4 id="Zivot-Andrews-Unit-Root-Test"><a href="#Zivot-Andrews-Unit-Root-Test" class="headerlink" title="Zivot-Andrews Unit-Root Test"></a>Zivot-Andrews Unit-Root Test</h4><p>　Through the Zivot-Andrews Test, we can statistically find the exact date of the structural break so that we can split the data into two periods to do analysis. We can observe two clearly different periods of Bitcoin market: before 2017/11/16 and after this breakpoint.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-53.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<h4 id="Johansen-Cointegration-Test"><a href="#Johansen-Cointegration-Test" class="headerlink" title="Johansen Cointegration Test"></a>Johansen Cointegration Test</h4><p>　Through the unit root test above, we can know that there are seven groups of data that are integrated of the same order I(1). Then we will use these groups of data to find the long-term equilibrium relationship between each other and use the cointegration test to judge the regression model in the next steps. For the data without cointegration, we use the VAR model for regression. For the data with cointegration, we use the VEC model for regression.In the Johansen test, we also need to determine the lag values, which we can obtain by using the AIC criterion. Since there are trace and eigenvalue two types of cointegration test, by comparing the statistical numbers of Johansen test with the critical value given in 1% critical value, we can obtain the number of cointegration relationship in each data combination.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-55.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<h4 id="Vector-Error-Correction-VEC-Model"><a href="#Vector-Error-Correction-VEC-Model" class="headerlink" title="Vector Error Correction (VEC) Model"></a>Vector Error Correction (VEC) Model</h4><p>　This model will help us find the long-term equilibrium relationship among those data combinations that have cointegration relationships. Through the above tests, we can know that the data are with cointegration. Therefore, we use the VEC model for regression to find out the long-term equilibrium relationship between combination groups with cointegration.</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-54.png" alt="upload successful"><br>　We can know from the result that we obtain from VEC: regardless of Period 1 or Period 2, the number of Bitcoin has a little long-term impact on Bitcoin price. In Period 1, the number of transactions has a negative impact on Bitcoin price in the long run, which means that when the number of transactions increases, the Bitcoin price drops. Since the number of addresses and that of transactions represent the same kind of influence, they should have the same influence on the Bitcoin price in the data. In terms of two periods, the number of transactions always has a negative impact, and the impact of the number of addresses is not significant. For the exchange rate, the performance in Period 1 is not the same as our previous assumption. While the exchange rate increases, the Bitcoin price decreases, which means it has a negative influence. In Period 2, the influence of exchange rate becomes positive. On the other side, the Bitcoin price in the second stage can be reflected as unreasonable and deviates from the normal value. For the days destroyed, thigs become the opposite: in Period 1, days destroyed has a positive impact on the Bitcoin price. The number of news posts is an indicator used to measure the trends of investors’ behavior in the market. In the hypothesis, the more news posts about Bitcoin, the more investors pay close attention to Bitcoin, which means the number of news posts should have a positive impact on Bitcoin price. From the long-term relationship, we can see that this effect does exist.</p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>　In the long run, the number of Bitcoin has no significant impact on Bitcoin price while other variables do. The exchange rate and days destroyed have the influence as our expectations. One has a positive impact and the other has a negative impact. The number of news posts always has a positive impact on Bitcoin price. In the short run, the impacts of all variables are all trivial. The factors have lag impacts on Bitcoin price. They will continuously incline over time, except the number of news posts which will reach its highest point, then decline.</p>
